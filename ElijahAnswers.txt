    1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  
    It can also be a personal or school project.  
    
    Getting my first job as a tech for the Chamber of Commerce.
    It was a dream first job in that I did everything and got to figure out what kind of
    hacker I wanted to be. I'm proud of my humble roots in early web development and 
    really happy that I decided to follow the Coder path over System Administration and 
    definitely over FileMakerPro Database Administration
    
    2. Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. 
    (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc) 
    
    I am reading a book called the Great Sea, about the sailors in the Mediterranean, 
    which discusses how cultures influenced each other in the past through exchange. The web
    is like the new Mediterranean, but what took years, now takes seconds. Something to think about.


    3. How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does? 
    Facilitates financial transactions between medical payers and providers.
